# Bday Discord Bot

Discord bot for birthday gift cycles in a single `#bday` channel. Runs on Unraid via Docker with Postgres persistence, daily scheduler, encrypted addresses, and thread-based flows.

## Features
- Single channel with per-birthday threads (created T-21).
- Surprise mode: birthday person cannot view their thread.
- Suggest → vote (👍) → winner (T-5) → claim → receipt → split → `/paid` tracking.
- 7‑day post‑receipt DM reminders for unpaid participants.
- Purchaser overrides: `/mark-paid` and `/mark-unpaid`.
- AES‑256‑GCM encryption for address storage.
- Daily cron scheduler (no in‑memory timers only).

## Requirements
- Discord app + bot token.
- Unraid host with Docker.
- Postgres container (via `docker-compose.yml`).

## Setup
1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and fill:
   - `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   - `CLIENT_ID`
   - `BDAY_CHANNEL_ID`
   - `DATABASE_URL` (already set for Docker compose)
   - `ADDRESS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` (32 bytes, hex or base64)
   - `TZ`
2. Start containers:
   ```sh
   docker compose up -d
   ```
3. The container will:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run DB migrations
   - Register slash commands
   - Start the bot

### Generate Encryption Key
```sh
openssl rand -hex 32
```

## Permissions
Ensure the bot has these permissions in the server and `#bday` channel:
- View Channel
- Send Messages
- Create Public Threads
- Manage Threads (for archiving)
- Read Message History
- Add Reactions
- Send Messages in Threads
- Manage Messages (optional, for cleanup)

## Commands
Global:
- `/register birthday:YYYY-MM-DD` → opens private modals for address + payment info

Thread-only:
- `/suggest url:<link>`
- `/claim`
- `/receipt total:<number>`
- `/paid`
- `/status`
- `/mark-paid user:@User [note]`
- `/mark-unpaid user:@User [note]`

If run outside a birthday thread, the bot responds with:
- “Please run this command inside a birthday thread.”

## Scheduler
- Daily cron set by `DAILY_CRON` (default: `0 9 * * *` local time).
- Creates threads at T‑21, closes voting at T‑5, sends reminders at receipt+7 days, and archives when complete.

## Data Storage
- Postgres tables: `users`, `circles`, `cycles`, `suggestions`, `payments`, `registration_sessions`.
- Addresses are encrypted before storage and only decrypted for purchaser DMs.

## Backups
- Nightly `pg_dump` to `/mnt/user/backups/autogift/`
- Retention: last 30 dumps

## Troubleshooting
- Commands not appearing: re-run in container `npm run register:commands`.
- Permissions issues: verify thread permissions for bot and channel.
- Encryption errors: confirm `ADDRESS_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is exactly 32 bytes.
